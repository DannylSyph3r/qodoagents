# Qodo Agents

This repository contains agents implementations examples, to be used with [Qodo Command](https://github.com/qodo-ai/command), showcasing best practices and common patterns for building AI-powered development workflows.

See [the Qodo Command docs](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command/) to learn more about using agents with Qodo Command.

## What are Qodo Agents?

Qodo Agents are configurable AI workflows that combine:
- **Instructions**: Natural language prompts that define the agent's behavior
- **Tools**: MCP servers and external integrations the agent can use
- **Arguments**: Configurable parameters for customization
- **Execution Strategy**: How the agent approaches tasks (plan vs act)
- **Output Schema**: Structured output format for integration
- **Exit Expressions**: Success/failure conditions for CI/CD

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Qodo Command](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command) installed
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git for version control

## Quickstart

[See the Qodo Command Quickstart and setup documentation](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command/getting-started/setup-and-quickstart) to learn how to setup Qodo Command and start using agents.

## How to Use an Existing Agent

All agents in this repository reside in the `agents` folder.

You can specify a custom agent configuration file in two ways: Remote or Local. Both methods allow you to customize agent behavior without modifying core logic.

### Remote Agent File

Use a remote URL to point to an agent configuration file with the flag:

```bash
--agent-file=URL
```

Example:

```bash
my-tool --agent-file=https://example.com/agents/my-agent.toml
```

### Local Agent File

Download or create a local agent `.toml` file and specify its path.

[See the Qodo Command documentation to learn how to write an customized agent `.toml` file.

## How to Create an Agent

### Basic Agent Structure

```toml
# agent.toml
version = "1.0"
[commands.my_agent]
description = "Detailed description for users"
instructions = """
Your agent's behavior instructions here.
Be specific about the task and expected outcomes.
"""

# Optional: Define arguments
arguments = [
   { name = "input_file", type = "string", required = true, description = "Input file path" },
   { name = "threshold", type = "number", required = false, default = 0.8, description = "Quality threshold" }
]

# Optional: MCP servers your agent uses
mcpServers = """
{
    "shell": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-shell-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALLOW_COMMANDS": "..."
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
}
"""

# Optional: Define available tools
tools = ["filesystem", "git", "shell", "github"]

# Optional: Define execution strategy: "plan" for multi-step, "act" for direct execution
execution_strategy = "act"

# Optional: Define expected output structure
output_schema = """
{
    "properties": {
        "success": {"type": "boolean"},
        "results": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
        "score": {"type": "number"}
    }
}
"""

# Optional: Success condition for CI/CD
exit_expression = "success"
```

### Agent Development Guidelines

1. **Clear Instructions**: Write specific, actionable instructions
2. **Proper Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate MCP servers and tools
3. **Error Handling**: Include error scenarios in instructions
4. **Testing**: Provide test cases and expected outputs
5. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive README and examples

### Testing Your Agent

```bash
# Test with sample data
qodo my_agent --set input1=0.9 --set input2="test"

# CI/CD integration test
qodo my_agent --ci --set input1=0.9 --set input2="test"
```
