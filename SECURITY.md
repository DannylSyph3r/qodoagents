## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Qodo Command Agent Reference Implementations team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: **security@qodo.ai**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After submitting a report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
4. **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We'll work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- We'll keep you informed throughout the process
- We'll publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We'll coordinate the timing of public disclosure

## Security Considerations for Agent Implementations

### General Security Guidelines

When developing or deploying agents from this repository, please consider:

#### 1. Input Validation
- **Sanitize all user inputs** before processing
- **Validate file paths** to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Limit input size** to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Use allowlists** for acceptable input patterns when possible

#### 2. Code Execution Safety
- **Sandbox code execution** when running user-provided code
- **Limit system access** for agent processes
- **Validate commands** before execution
- **Use secure defaults** for all configurations

#### 3. Data Protection
- **Never log sensitive information** (API keys, passwords, personal data)
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- **Implement proper access controls** for configuration files
- **Use secure communication channels** for API calls

#### 4. Dependency Management
- **Keep dependencies updated** to latest secure versions
- **Regularly audit dependencies** for known vulnerabilities
- **Use dependency scanning tools** in CI/CD pipelines
- **Pin dependency versions** for reproducible builds

#### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- **Implement proper authentication** for agent access
- **Use principle of least privilege** for system permissions
- **Rotate API keys and tokens** regularly
- **Implement session management** securely

### Specific Security Considerations by Language

#### Python Agents
```python
# ❌ Dangerous - Direct execution of user input
exec(user_input)

# ✅ Safe - Use ast.literal_eval for safe evaluation
import ast
try:
    result = ast.literal_eval(user_input)
except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
    # Handle invalid input
    pass
```

#### Node.js Agents
```javascript
// ❌ Dangerous - Direct execution
eval(userInput);

// ✅ Safe - Use JSON.parse for data
try {
    const data = JSON.parse(userInput);
} catch (error) {
    // Handle invalid JSON
}
```

#### Go Agents
```go
// ❌ Dangerous - Command injection
cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", userInput)

// ✅ Safe - Validate and sanitize input
if isValidCommand(userInput) {
    cmd := exec.Command("program", sanitizedArgs...)
}
```

### Environment Security

#### Development Environment
- Use virtual environments or containers
- Don't commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Enable security linting tools

#### Production Environment
- Run agents with minimal privileges
- Use container security best practices
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Regular security updates and patches

### Configuration Security

#### Secure Configuration Examples

```yaml
# config.yaml
security:
  max_input_size: 1048576  # 1MB limit
  allowed_file_extensions: [".py", ".js", ".md"]
  sandbox_enabled: true
  log_level: "INFO"  # Don't use DEBUG in production
  
network:
  timeout: 30
  max_connections: 10
  allowed_hosts: ["api.example.com"]
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Use for sensitive configuration
export QODO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export QODO_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export QODO_SANDBOX_ENABLED="true"
```
